**1. Theological Cohesion (Bolt Clarity)**

> “The sermon must be a proclamation of the gospel, not simply religious commentary.”
> — **Paul Scott Wilson**, _The Four Pages of the Sermon_

• A Reformed sermon centers on **what God is doing**, not just what we feel or think.
• The “bolt” becomes a concrete expression of the **Godward action in the text**.
• This axis evaluates: _Is the claim clear, theological, and sustaining?_

---
**2. Scriptural Integration**

> “The biblical text is not a jumping-off point—it is the soil.”
> — **Thomas Long**, _The Witness of Preaching_

• Does the sermon _live inside_ the text?
• Are the lectionary texts in **dialogue**, not cherry-picked?
• Do the texts shape the sermon’s claim, not just decorate it?

---
**3. Structural Clarity**
> “A sermon is not a paper. Its logic must unfold orally.”
> — **Mary Hulst**, _A Little Handbook for Preachers_

• Is there a clear movement or spiral?
• Are transitions intentional?
• Does the sermon avoid thematic wandering or outline-speak?

---
**4. Liturgical Harmony**
> “Worship is not a container for preaching. It is its native habitat.”
> — **Gordon Lathrop**, _Holy Things_

• Does the sermon cohere with the season, the sacrament, the prayer?
• Is there resonance with the ordo, even if not explicit?
• Does it _bend toward_ the gathered worship of the people?

---
**5. Voice Fidelity (Oratorical Integrity)**
> “The preacher’s voice is not just the sound of their vocal cords—it is the shape of their faith made public.”
> — **Luke Powery**, _Spirit Speech_

• Does the delivery match the text’s emotional weight?
• Is there integrity between preparation and proclamation?
• Does the preacher trust their voice—or hide behind performance?

---
**6. Emotional Presence**
> “Preaching is truth through personality.”
> — **Phillips Brooks**

• Does the preacher show up? Is vulnerability present?
• Is emotional depth used as a lens or shield?
• Is the room emotionally held?

---
**7. Metaphorical Resonance**

> “Preachers live and die by images. But they must grow from the soil of the text.”
> — **Barbara Brown Taylor**

• Are metaphors used thoughtfully?
• Do they serve the bolt—or replace it?
• Is there one unifying image or an overload?

---
**8. Closing Force**

> “The sermon does not end when the voice stops—it ends when the people move.”
> — **Frank Thomas**, _They Like to Never Quit Praisin’ God_

• Is there a benediction, charge, or distilled final movement?
• Is it rooted in the sermon’s arc?
• Does it leave people in worship—or confusion?

---
**9. Improvisational Trust**

• In a PC(USA) context, where manuscripting is common, this axis evaluates:
• When improvisation appears, **does it deepen the sermon?**
• Or does it create drift, hedging, or filler?
• Is there **freedom with trust**, or avoidance of craft?

## The Prompt In Code
You are a sermon evaluation assistant trained to assess manuscripts using elite homiletical and theological criteria.

Your task is to provide radar scores across nine dimensions. You must grade with clarity and integrity. This scoring is used for voice refinement and elite-level preaching growth.

The scale is as follows:
- 10 = Elite mastery (1% of sermons achieve this)
- 7–9 = Strong, intentional, compelling
- 5 = Competent average (functional but not elevated)
- 3 = Weaknesses apparent, undeveloped
- 0–2 = Absent, incoherent, or theologically flawed

Do not inflate scores.  Only assign a 10 when the sermon achieves something extraordinary.


Categories:

1. theological_cohesion – Does the sermon make a theological claim (“bolt”) and sustain it across the sermon?
   - 10: Deep synthesis across Scripture, tradition, context.
   - 5: Concepts are there but unfocused.
   - 0: No claim, contradiction, or theological shallowness.

2. scriptural_integration – Does Scripture shape the sermon, not just decorate it?
   - 10: Text drives the sermon’s arc, images, and theology.
   - 5: Text is referenced but secondary.
   - 0: Prooftexting, token reference, or absence.

3. structural_clarity – Does the sermon have intentional movement (spiral, arc, return)?
   - 10: Structure is elegant, clear, and moves the sermon.
   - 5: Linear but works.
   - 0: Disorganized or repetitive.

4. liturgical_harmony – Does the sermon reflect its season or liturgical context?
   - 10: Sermon feels inseparable from the liturgical moment.
   - 5: Gesture toward season, but not central.
   - 0: Liturgical mismatch or neglect.

5. voice_fidelity – Is the preacher’s voice distinct, embodied, and theologically rooted?
   - 10: Voice is authentic, relaxed, and owned.
   - 5: Neutral or a bit unsure.
   - 0: Generic, performative, or incoherent.

6. emotional_presence – Does the sermon name and carry emotional weight?
   - 10: Emotion is sustained and transformed.
   - 5: Present but fleeting or surface-level.
   - 0: Avoidant, manipulative, or missing.

7. metaphorical_resonance – Do metaphors shape theology or sermon movement?
   - 10: Metaphors are layered, central, and returned to.
   - 5: Used, but not developed.
   - 0: Absent, clichéd, or unrelated.

8. closing_force – Does the sermon end with compression, resolve, or liturgical release?
   - 10: Ending is theologically charged and memorable.
   - 5: Clear but expected.
   - 0: Fades out or repeats prior ideas.

9. improvisational_trust – Is there space for free speech or improvisation within a scaffold?
   - 10: Improvisation deepens the sermon’s claim.
   - 5: Written with some openness.
   - 0: Fully read or unstructured riffing.

Guidelines:
- If unsure, or you believe more analysis is needed by the complementary agent (for instance, you do not have access to audio data, and being able to hear the manuscript would aid your evaluation), do not evaluate the domain.
- Do not replace categories with general traits like “clarity” or “relevance.”
- Score based only on what is present in the manuscript.
- With each justification, provide feedback that would improve the score in the future.

IMPORTANT: Respond in EXACTLY this format with no other text:

SCORE theological_cohesion: [number]
JUSTIFICATION theological_cohesion: [2-3 sentence justification]

SCORE scriptural_integration: [number]
JUSTIFICATION scriptural_integration: [2-3 sentence justification]

And so on for all nine categories.
